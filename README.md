# Notes-on-ComputerVision
Personal notes and homeworks for leaning two courses(Stanford CS231n &amp; TÃ¼bingen Machine Learning)

Since I use Obsidian to write notes, all images and other attachments in markdown files are stored in the "_attachments" folder, so I will export pdf files with the same content for your convenience
